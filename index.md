## Why "Xanthan"?

Xanthan gum is a polysaccharide used as a binder and emulsifier---it transforms different ingredients into something greater than the sum of their parts. It brings things to together and keeps them stable. 

Similarly, this template binds simple technologies (HTML, CSS, Markdown) into a stable framework for digital scholarship. Plus, it's fun to say. And it's already in everything!
